# Image Classification on CIFAR-10 (PyTorch)

## Project Overview

This repository contains a PyTorch-based implementation of an image classification model trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset.  
CIFAR-10 is a popular benchmark dataset consisting of 60,000 32×32 color images across 10 object classes.

The goal is to build, train, and evaluate a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that can learn visual features and classify images effectively also to evaluate the calssifier and to understand it via model interpretability through various methods such as attributions, metrics, etc.

## Key Features

- Loads and preprocesses the CIFAR-10 dataset
- Defines a CNN architecture for image classification
- Trains the model using a training loop with optimizer and loss
- Evaluates model performance on validation/test data
- Visualizes training progress and sample predictions
- Interpretability of the trained model.
